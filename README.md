<h1>This is my first project.</h1>

In this project I will create a basic HTML webpage about venezuelan recipes and I will post it on GitHub.

I'll use basic HTML elements such as paragraphs, links, images, lists, and others.

In order to success, I should configure correctly both the webpage and the GitHub repository.
